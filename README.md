# SKBPB Demo

This is the SvelteKit code for my [SKPB Techstack Demo app](https://skpb-demo.fly.dev/)

If you want to use the same interface, go ahead and clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/kllarena07/SKPB-Demo.git`

The backend, _SvelteKit blurs the line for frontend and backend_, code for this demo is also in this repository

## Somethings to Note

1. This app uses SvelteKit v4, and PocketBase v0.19
2. PNPM was used as the main package manager instead of NPM. So, first install [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) and use `pnpm install`
3. This app was containerized with Docker, with the container being deployed to [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)
4. This app uses JSDoc, but TypeScript can also be used

The instructions for how to create fully create a CRUD SKPB app can be found on my [personal blog](https://bytesfromkrayon.hashnode.dev/)
